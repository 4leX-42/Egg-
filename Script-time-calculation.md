# Time required for clicks:
- Every 10 seconds: 1000 clicks
  
## Calculation for specific clicks:
- **500,000 clicks:**
  - (500,000 clicks) / (100 clicks/second) = 5000 seconds
  - 5000 seconds = 1 hour and 23 minutes
  
- **1,000,000 clicks:**
  - (1,000,000 clicks) / (100 clicks/second) = 10,000 seconds
  - 10,000 seconds = 2 hours and 46 minutes
